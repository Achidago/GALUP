## Introduction

In Ghana, farmlands and cities are expanding rapidly into the savannas,
woodlands and forests.
The Ghana Land Use Project ([GALUP](http://galup.cersgis.org/)) project will
enhance the current operational planning framework and building capacity for
effective land use planning in Ghana.
Working in close collaboration with national and regional authorities in
Ashanti, Eastern and Central Regions in Ghana, the project aims to build local
capacity in the region regarding remote sensing and GIS, and transfer the land
use planning framework for continued planning.

## About the Land Use Planning Framework

The planning framework GALUP proposed is based on the Land-Use Identification
Strategy (LUCIS) developed by two professors, Margaret Carr and Paul Zwick, at
the University of Florida. LUCIS, at its core, is a GIS-based land-use
suitability modeling framework. LUCIS models were originally developed using
ModelBuilder in ArcMap&trade;.
The GALUP team developed the **LUCIS-OPEN Tools for QGIS** by using
[PyLUSAT](https://github.com/chjch/pylusat)—Python for Land-Use Suitability
Analysis Tools—and the [QGIS Python API](https://qgis.org/pyqgis/3.10/).
These tools enable land-use planners to perform suitability analysis on
[QGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/preamble/foreword.html#foreword),
an open-source GIS software application.

## GALUP Trainings

One of GALUP’s objectives is to help build local capacity in applying tools
empowered by Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS)
technologies to inform and ensure sustainable land use practices.

### Workshop #1 - Land-Use Suitability Analysis with QGIS Tools
