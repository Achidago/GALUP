# Workshop 3: Integrated Decision Units for Land Use Suitability Modeling

> **Instructor**: [Dr. Changjie Chen](https://github.com/chjch) (<ins>chj.chen@<i></i>ufl.edu</ins>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Date**: April 11 - April 15, 2022

### Goal

The third GALUP workshop focuses on the creation of Integrated Decision Units
(IDUs) using geoprocessing tools in **QGIS**.
IDUs are land units, within which land properties (or attributes) are
homogeneous.
Such **homogeneity** ensures the integrity of a land use decision.
For rural or less developed area, **_delineation of land units_** is a critical
step that must take place before the process of land suitability analysis.
Participants will be able to independently create IDUs for any region if base
input data are provided.

### Objectives

- Understand key concepts of IDU and why it is useful to land use planning
- Capable of using **16 tools** in QGIS involved in the process
- Independently create IDUs for different regions
