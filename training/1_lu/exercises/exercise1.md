# Exercise 1

## 1. Description
    
We provided you a exercise to illustate the populaton distribution of Ghana by
using QGIS. To better understand how population are distributed in Ghana, you
need to visually present the number of population in each regions of Ghana.

You should use _Gh\_260\_MMDA.shp_ to finish this exercise.

## 2. Skills Practices

This exercise cover the knowledge about:

- Acquire the datasets and Add the data to map.
- Symbolize vector layers.
- Create a layout to print the map.

## 3. Instruction
- Find data (_Gh\_260\_MMDA.shp_) in _Browser Panel_ and Add data to the _map canvas_
- Open _Attribute Table_ to review the field (_Pop_2018_) containing population data.
- Select _Graduated_ option and Find the target field (_Pop_2018_) in _Value_.
- Choose _Reds_ color ramp with 5 classes to render the population distribution.
- Add _ESRI Gray (light)_ as your basemap.
- Create a _Layout_ and Add a _Legend_, a _Scale bar_, and a _North Arrow_.
- Export your map with appropriate map parameters as a PDF file.

## 4.Result
