# Exercise 1

## 1. Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
You should use _Gh\_260\_MMDA.shp_ to finish this exercise.
=======
In this exercise, we will visualize the distribution of population in Ghana in
year 2018 by using a **Graduated** symbology on population in each district of
Ghana.

You should use _Gh\_260\_MMDA.shp_ at
`GALUP-master -> training -> 1_lu -> datasets -> District of Ghana`
to finish this exercise.

## 2. Skills Practices

This exercise covers:

- load GIS data to Map Canvas in QGIS,
- change the symbology of vector layers,
- create a layout and print a map as a pdf file.

## 3. Instruction
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Find data (_Gh\_260\_MMDA.shp_) in _Browser Panel_ and Add data to the _map canvas_
- Open _Attribute Table_ to review the field (_Pop_2018_) containing population data.
- Select _Graduated_ option and Find the target field (_Pop_2018_) in _Value_.
- Choose _Reds_ color ramp with 5 classes to render the population distribution.
- Add _ESRI Gray (light)_ as your basemap.
- Create a _Layout_ and Add a _Legend_, a _Scale bar_, and a _North Arrow_.
- Export your map with appropriate map parameters as a PDF file.

1. Locate _Gh\_260\_MMDA.shp_ in the _Browser Panel_ and add it to
   _Map Canvas_.
2. Open _Attribute Table_ to view the field, _Pop\_2018_, which represents
   population by district in 2018.
3. Choose _Graduated_ symbology and choose the _Reds_ color ramp with 5 classes
   to render the target field: _Pop\_2018_.
4. Add _ESRI Gray (light)_ as the basemap.
5. Create a _Layout_ and then add _Legend_, _Scale bar_, and _North Arrow_.
6. Export as a PDF file.
