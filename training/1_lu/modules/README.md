# Workshop #1: Land-Use Suitability Analysis with QGIS Tools

**Goal**: The first GALUP workshop aims at laying a foundation of core
concepts and techniques used in land-use suitability analysis, of which the
output will help inform land-use decision making.
Using QGIS, an open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) software
application, and the Processing Algorithms developed by the GALUP team, at the
conclusion of the workshop, trainees should be able to independently visualize
GIS data, conduct geospatial analysis, and identify suitable areas for a
particular land-use purpose.

**Objectives:**

- Understand key concepts in land use analysis
- Be familiar with the QGIS software
- Use LUCIS-Open Tools for QGIS to perform geospatial analysis
- Create models for suitability analysis using Graphical Modeler
- Interpret the result of land-use suitability analysis
- Making decisions when different purposes of land use are in conflict

## 3. Delivery Method

The training will be delivered through the
[GALUP](https://github.com/SERVIR-WA/GALUP) GitHub repository, including
software package, training materials, and exercises. So, we ask every
participant to get a GitHub Account which is completely free.

### 3.1. Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to the GitHub official website: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/), and click the [**Sign up**](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).
2. Type your 1) Username, 2) Email address, and 3) Password to set up for your account.
3. Finish the verification step and click **Create account**.

### 3.2. Turn in the Exercises

At the end of every Module, a dedicated link is provided for you to submit the
completed exercise files. In addition, we ask you to complete a post-training
survey for you to provide us feedbacks and comments to help us improve the
training materials so that we can adjust our materials in the future that
better suit your preferences.
