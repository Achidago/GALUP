# Module 3 - Create Suitability Models with QGIS Graphical Modeler

**What will you learn from this module?**

- Get to know the Graphical Modeler,
- Learn about the Row Crops model,
- Solve planning-related questions by modeling in the Graphical Modeler.

## 1. Graphical Modeler

## 2. Suitability Modeling

Suitability modeling is the most common application for the LUCIS-OPEN Tools in QGIS and can solve a variety of problems, for examples, you can use Tools to find the best place for a new housing development.

In this model, we will use Tools to do land suitability modeling. There are four types of land uses we need to determine for the IDUs in the THLD area: Row Crops, Livestock, Timberland, and Urban. In each of the land use, we have different decisive factors that help us . And, for each decisive factor, models will be used to evaluate multiple facets consisting of the decisive factor and give a land suitability score to each IDU, representing the suitability of one facet.
