# Workshop 2: Introduction to Satellite Remote Sensing

## Goal

The second GALUP workshop aims at providing core concepts of use for remote sensing applications in land use planning. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE), the participants will explore remote sensing data, learn common indices, and use simple land cover classification techniques. The goal is to have an understanding of how these techniques can be used for better land-use decision making. 

## Objectives

- Understand information obtained from different wavelengths/bands
- Learn about remote sensing systems and datasets
- Be familiar with Google Earth Engine
- Learn about commonly used indices and environmental variables from remote sensing
- Conduct supervised land cover classification using GEE
- Interpret the results from different land cover classifications

## Assignment Submission and Help

The participants will have to sign into their GitHub accounts to submit assignments. Below is a video explaining how to submit the module assignments and how to request help through GitHub. Note: It may be convenient to open videos in the workshop in a new tab or window to easily navigate the GitHub page.
