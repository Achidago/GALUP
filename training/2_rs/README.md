# Workshop 2: Satellite Remote Sensing for Land-use Planning

## Goal

The second GALUP workshop aims at providing core concepts of use for remote sensing applications in land use planning. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE), the participants will explore remote sensing data, learn common indices, and use simple land cover classification techniques. The goal is to have an understanding of how these techniques can be used for better land-use decision making. 

### Objectives

- Understand key concepts in land use analysis
- Be familiar with the QGIS software
- Use LUCIS-Open Tools for QGIS to perform geospatial analysis
- Create models for suitability analysis using Graphical Modeler
- Interpret the result of land-use suitability analysis
- Making decisions when different purposes of land use are in conflict

## Assignment Submission and Help

The participants will have to sign into their GitHub accounts to submit assignments. Below is a video explaining how to submit the module assignments and how to request help through GitHub. Note: It may be convenient to open videos in the workshop in a new tab or window to easily navigate the GitHub page.
